# wikisearch
Simple module written in Python that allows for searching on Wikipedia.

## Use Case : 
The module can be used to look for a particular wikipedia link, since redirecting to a page automatically may lead to a disambiguation.

## How to use 

Install BeautifulSoup 
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

### If you want to use it in your own program, use the search module. For testing the code browse to the directory the project is cloned to : 

```
python run.py
```

### Example
This module is implemented in a project by [Surabhi Samaddar](https://github.com/surabhi5/instant-ppt), where she generates a PowerPoint presentation using text summarization - the data is gathered from [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org)
